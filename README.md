# RangeX Task 1.1 Data Paper 

This repository contains all scripts used for data cleaning of RangeX Task 1.1 data collected in Norway, Switzerland and Southafrica betweem 2021 - 2024. 

The repository is organized by region and experimental level.

Each regional folder (CHE = Switzerland, NOR = Norway, ZAF = South Africa) contains scripts corresponding to different levels of data collection:
- focal_level/ – Data collected at the individual level (e.g., leaf traits, seed production, yearly demographic monitoring, root traits).
- plot_level/ – Data collected at the plot level (e.g., environmental data from HOBO and TMS loggers).
- site_level/ – Data collected at the site level (e.g., weather station data and other site-wide environmental measurements).

NOTES:
- Data cleaning scripts are written in R (≥ 4.2) using the tidyverse and related packages.
- Raw data are not included here due to size and data-sharing constraints. All raw data are archived through an OSF data repository.

The raw and cleaned datasets as well as the cleaning code will be published as part of a RangeX Task 1.1 data paper (currently under preparation).
